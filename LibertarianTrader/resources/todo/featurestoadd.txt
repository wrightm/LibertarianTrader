*Not Done* test fairness of stats probability to go up or down in price from a different period. 
*Not Done* need to calculate uncertainty of probability in gainAndLossesModule
*Not Done* add a project logging module (should log error, warning messages etc)
*Not Done* add a project settings module (use to set file directories, etc)
*Not Done* add to gainAndLosses module method of calculating probability of having n days of gains or losses (e.x. 50%*50% for a coin twice)
*Not Done* add Filter module (day filter, check other possible filters)
*Not Done* add BiasPmf that changes Pmf with a given Bias
